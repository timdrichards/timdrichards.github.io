# Tools and Things

I like tools that can make my life easier. As I interact with my students I
realize that many people struggle with interacting with computers because they
do not realize the incredible number of tools, shortcuts, and key mappings they
have access to to make their lives easier. So, I figured I might start write
about the various tools (and tricks) that I use to navigate my system. In
particular, I focus on Unix systems and the various ways in which you can use
them to enjoy a terminal life. I am not focusing (necessarily) on GUI tools
here, however, it is certainly possible that some might show up.

Let me start with a list I will write about these tools when I have time:

- terminal: tab completion and history search
- bat
- ls & exa
- pushd, popd, & dirs (oh my!)
- wc
- cal
- bash
- zsh
- editors

And more to come as I use them...
